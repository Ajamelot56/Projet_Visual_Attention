## Abstract

> *Previous studies have identified that images carry the attribute of memorability, a predictive value of whether a novel image will be later remembered or forgotten. Here we investigate the interplay between intrinsic and extrinsic factors that affect image memorability. First, we find that intrinsic differences in memorability exist at a finer-grained scale than previously documented. Second, we test two extrinsic factors: image context and observer behavior. Building on prior findings that images that are distinct with respect to their context are better remembered, we propose an information-theoretic model of image distinctiveness. Our model can automatically predict how changes in context change the memorability of natural images. In addition to context, we study a second extrinsic factor: where an observer looks while memorizing an image. It turns out that eye movements provide additional information that can predict whether or not an image will be remembered, on a trial-by-trial basis. Together, by considering both intrinsic and extrinsic effects on memorability, we arrive at a more complete and finegrained model of image memorability than previously available.*

### Summary of the abstract

This article studies the *memorability* of images.

There are *intrinsic* and *extrinsic* factors that affect memorability, especially two extrinsic factors:

1. *Image context*: images that differ from their context are better remembered.
2. *Observer behaviour*: the observer’s eye movements show information about wether the observer will remember the image or not.

The model uses these informations to predict how likely an image is to be remembered.

## Summary of the conclusion

The “memorability” of images is consistent across participants and across experiments with varying contexts.

However, the context has an incidence on the memorability. “Images that are most distinct from their image context are the most memorable, and image contexts with the highest entropy have the highest overall memorability scores”.

The authors introduced a model to predict wether an image will be remembered based on the observer’s eye movements. The memorability also relies on the observer’s expertise, and the image’s familiarity and utility. For example, faces are highly useful to remember, and easily become familiar.

“Intrinsic” image memorability can be seen as the base memorability of an image for every context, whereäs “extrinsic” effects modify the memorability on a particular trial.

The authors suggest that their work could be used to build better user interfaces and educational tools.
